<t>
Google Wave is a communication and collaboration platform based on hosted
conversations, called waves. A wave comprises a set of concurrently editable
structured documents and supports real-time sharing between multiple
participants. This document is one in a larger set of specifications for Google
Wave. This specification describes Google Wave conversation manifest document
schema and blip document schema, which together define the Google Wave
conversation model. This application model is layered upon the documents,
operations and operational transformation defined in the Wave Federation
Protocol; see http://waveprotocol.org.</t>

<section title="Introduction"><t>
A wave can be used to represent a conversation. This specification describes
the Google Wave conversation model, which implements the conversation structure
within structured documents in a wave.</t>
</section><section title="Applicability"><t>
The wave documents described in this specification may, in whole or in part, be
interchanged between servers via the Google Wave Federation Protocol. The
structure within a wave document is reminiscent of XML. A document contains an
XML-like tree structure of elements, with attributes, and text. In addition, a
document includes stand-off key/value annotations over arbitrary ranges.
Documents are subject to constraints expressed in schemas similar to XML
schemas.</t>
<t>
The use of XML in this specification in no way forces the server implementation
to be XML-based. That is, XML is used as a convenient model and implementations
are free to implement that model in the manner that is most convenient and
performant.</t>

</section><section title="Roadmap"><t>
Wave is being actively developed and some features of the
conversation model have not been documented, or may change in
the short term. Currently undocumented are annotations, RTL
text, images, and form elements.</t>
<t>
Here is a short roadmap of upcoming changes:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
A mechanism for signalling blip submission</t>
<t>
A mechanism for signalling relevance of changes</t>
<t>
Modification timestamps</t>
<t>
Cursors and selections</t>
<t>
Attachments</t>
<t>
Rich text</t>
</list>
</t>
</section><section title="Relationship between specifications"><t>
The Federation Protocol specifies the form and function of
operations that mutate wave documents. While this specification
deals only with conversation manifest documents and blip
documents, a wavelet may contain documents of other types.
Wavelets have metadata that is not stored in document form,
including the wave id, wavelet id, and list of named
participants for the wavelet. See the Federation Protocol for
more details on wavelets and participants.</t>
</section><section title="Terminology"><t>
The following terminology is used by this specification:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
wave - a collection of wavelets</t>
<t>
wavelet - a collection of named documents and participants, and the domain of operational transformation</t>
<t>
conversation - an interpretation of a wavelet as a structured collection of messages</t>
<t>
document - a structured wave document</t>
<t>
blip - a document containing a conversational message</t>
<t>
thread - a sequence of blips, each a &quot;continuation&quot; to that before it</t>
<t>
conversation manifest - a document that defines the structure of a conversation</t>
<t>
reply - a thread that represents a reply to conversation material appearing above it</t>
<t>
inline reply - a reply anchored to a particular point in the replied-to blip</t>
<t>
private reply - a conversation wavelet with a restricted set of participants</t>
</list>
</t>
</section><section title="Model"><t>
A conversation wave is a forest of conversations. Each
conversation has a set of participants collaborating on a
structured collection of blips. The structure of the
conversation is maintained in the conversation manifest
document, while the content of the conversational messages is
stored in blip documents. Clients participate in the
conversation by sending operations which mutate the
conversation manifest and blips.</t>
<t>
The following assumptions about the wave model and operational
transforms should be kept in mind when reading this
specification.</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
A wavelet may contain many documents which may or may
not be part of the conversation. This specification
addresses only the two document types needed for the
conversation model: blip documents and conversation
manifest documents.</t>
<t>
Documents not referenced by the conversation manifest
are data documents and are not part of the conversation
content.</t>
</list>
</t>
<section title="Document namespace and validation"><t>
Every document in a wavelet has an identifier unique within the wavelet. Ids of
documents are structured as a sequence of '+'-separated tokens. The first token
of the id is conventionally the document namespace. That wavelet and document
namespace determine the type of document (its schema). Different types of
documents may have different validity constraints. Operations which violate the
schema for a document must be rejected by the server.</t>
<t>
The namespaces for the documents described in this specification are:</t>

</section><section title="Documents"><t>
This section describes the two document types that make up the conversation
model.As a general principle of data modeling in waves, metadata is embedded in
documents where it can be manipulated by operations. The conversation metadata
includes the message structure and contributors. Below are examples of a blip
document and a conversation manifest document.</t>
<t>
Blip document example:</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
&lt;contributor name=&quot;dadams@acmewave.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/contributor&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;There is a theory which states that if
    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;ever anybody discovers exactly what the
    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;Universe is for and why it
    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;is here, it will instantly disappear and
    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;be replaced by something even more bizarre
    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;and inexplicable. There is another theory
    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;which states that this has already happened.
&lt;/body&gt;</artwork>

Conversation manifest document example:</t>
<figure>

&lt;conversation sort=&quot;m&quot;&gt;
    &lt;blip id=&quot;b+a&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- first message --&gt;
        &lt;thread id=&quot;3Fsd&quot;&gt;
            &lt;blip id=&quot;b+aaa&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt; &lt;!-- indented reply to &quot;b+a&quot; --&gt;
            &lt;blip id=&quot;b+aab&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt; &lt;!-- continuation to &quot;b+aaa&quot; --&gt;
        &lt;/thread&gt;
        &lt;thread id=&quot;jjKs&quot;&gt;
            &lt;blip id=&quot;b+aba&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt; &lt;!-- another reply to &quot;b+a&quot; --&gt;
        &lt;/thread&gt;
    &lt;/blip&gt;

            &lt;blip id=&quot;b+bab&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt; &lt;!-- continuation to &quot;b+aaa&quot; --&gt;
        &lt;/thread&gt;
        &lt;thread inline=&quot;true&quot; ... &gt; &lt;!-- another inline reply group,
            possibly at the same location --&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/thread&gt;
        &lt;thread id=&quot;9dKx&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- non-inline reply to &quot;b+b&quot; --&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/thread&gt;
    &lt;/blip&gt;
&lt;/conversation&gt;</artwork>
</figure>
</section><section title="Conversation Manifest Document"><t>
A conversation manifest document has the distinguished document
id 'conversation', and is the only document in the
'conversation' namespace. There is one conversation manifest
document per conversation.</t>
<t>
The conversation manifest defines the logical structure of the
conversation by describing the relationships between the blips.
See the Display section for how the logical structure of
conversations is reflected in the user-interface of a wave
client.</t>
<t>
Blip elements are wrapped in a grouping element 'thread',
except for top-level blips which belong to an implicit root
thread. A blip may have multiple child 'thread' elements
representing replies. Each 'thread' element has an id, unique
within the conversation. Thread ids have no semantic meaning.</t>
<t>
Here is a very simple conversation manifest that references only a single blip.</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
&lt;conversation&gt;
    &lt;blip id=&quot;b+a&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- first and only message --&gt;
    &lt;/blip&gt;
&lt;/conversation&gt;</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
Here is a more complex conversation manifest that references multiple blips.</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
&lt;conversation&gt;
    &lt;blip id=&quot;b+a&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- first message --&gt;
        &lt;thread id=&quot;x123&quot;&gt;
            &lt;blip id=&quot;b+aaa&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt; &lt;!-- indented reply to &quot;b+a&quot; --&gt;
        &lt;/thread&gt;
        &lt;thread inline=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;x983&quot;&gt;
            &lt;blip id=&quot;b+aba&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt; &lt;!-- another reply to &quot;b+a&quot; --&gt;
            &lt;blip id=&quot;b+abb&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt; &lt;!-- another reply to &quot;b+a&quot; --&gt;
        &lt;/thread&gt;
    &lt;/blip&gt;
&lt;/conversation&gt;</artwork>
</figure>
<section title="Elements"><t>
These are the allowed elements in a conversation manifest.</t>
<section title="conversation"><t>
The top-level element in a conversation manifest document.
It may have anchor attributes (&quot;anchorWavelet&quot;,
&quot;anchorManifestOffset&quot;, &quot;anchorVersion&quot;, &quot;anchorBlip&quot;,
&quot;anchorOffset&quot;), which determine where this conversation is
displayed. See the section below on private replies.
It also has a &quot;sort&quot; attribute. The value of the sort attribute is used to
determine the order of peer conversation elements by sorting on sort values
lexicographically.  A conversation element has zero or more 'blip' elements as
children.</t>
<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="anchorWavelet">
The id of the wavelet that this conversation is a reply to.</t>
<t hangText="anchorManifestOffset">
An integer offset into the document sequence for the parent's conversation manifest.</t>
<t hangText="anchorVersion">
The version of the parent wavelet when the private reply was created.</t>
<t hangText="anchorBlip">
The id of the blip document in the parent wavelet that anchors the reply.</t>
<t hangText="anchorOffset">
An integer offset into the replied-to blip document that anchors the private reply.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section><section title="blip"><t>
Represents a message. Every blip element has an 'id'
attribute that references a blip document in the
conversation. It may also have a 'deleted' attribute whose
boolean value determines if that blip has been logically
deleted. See the section below on deleting blips.
A blip may have zero or more 'thread' and 'peer' elements
as children.</t>
</section><section title="thread"><t>
Represents a sequence of messages. All sibling blips in a thread element are
considered a reply to the parent blip element.  A thread element has an
&quot;id&quot; and optional boolean &quot;inline&quot; attribute. The &quot;inline&quot; attribute determines
whether the thread is anchored inline in the parent blip. The default value
for &quot;inline&quot; if false, that is, the inline attribute not being present is
the same thing as inline=false. A thread may have zero or more 'blip' elements as children.</t>
</section><section title="peer"><t>
A peer element has an &quot;id&quot; attribute. The &quot;id&quot; attribute value is the id of a
data document. The identified data document is not a blip or conversation
manifest document.</t>
</section></section><section title="Private Replies"><t>
Private replies are represented as distinct wavelets with their
own conversation manifest containing a reference to the parent
conversation wavelet. Sub-conversations reference the parent
conversation's manifest document with a (wavelet-id, blip-id,
location, version) tuple referred to as an anchor. This tuple
refers to a parent blip by naming the replied-to wavelet and
blip. The location and version attributes refer
to the corresponding blip element in the replied-to
conversation's manifest document at some previous version. This
ensures the information is still present if the parent blip is
deleted.</t>
<t>
An inline private reply also references an anchor point in the
replied-to blip at a selected version. A forthcoming mechanism
will allow clients to request a server to transform a location
to the current version for rendering.</t>
<t>
This representation prevents leakage of the existence of the
private reply to participants who cannot access it. Note that
this structure still leaks the existence of the parent
conversation to the private reply.</t>
<t>
The anchoring tuple is represented as a set of optional attributes on the
conversation tag of the conversation manifest document.</t>

    &lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</artwork>
</figure>
<section title="Schema Design"><t>
The documents representing messages (blips) conform to a very simple schema.</t>
<t>
The blip document schema expresses a structured representation of the message
with little presentation logic, and is mostly not web-specific. For example,
most rich-text styling is represented in annotations. This representation
behaves in a much more natural way when two clients concurrently edit
overlapping regions of text. The document representation may not correspond to
the most natural semantic interpretation, but is designed to behave most
naturally under operational transformation.</t>
</section><section title="Elements"><t>
The allowed elements of a blip are:</t>
<section title="contributor"><t>
Each contributor element has a single
required attribute 'name' with the id of a participant who
has contributed to the blip content. If there are duplicates
(which may occur with concurrent editing) then the first is
the canonical contributor and the others should be ignored or
removed. Individual contributors are responsible for adding themselves
to this list. This allows for &quot;trivial&quot; contributors such as
annotators to voluntarily omit themselves. Absolute
contributor information may be recovered from the operation
history if required.</t>
</section><section title="body"><t>
The displayed content of the blip. The body element may
contain text and 'line' elements. The first child of the body
element must be a line element. If a document contains two
body elements then the first is the canonical body and others
should be ignored or removed.</t>
</section><section title="line"><t>
The displayed textual content of a blip
is broken up into lines. Each line is preceded with a &quot;line&quot;
element. The line element must be an empty element, that is,
having no other items between the begin element and the end
element. The line element may have the following attributes:</t>
<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="t">
The type of the line. Allowed values
are 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', and 'li', where h[1-5] is a
heading and 'li' an item in a list.</t>
<t hangText="i">
The indentation level (0,1,2,...). This attribute is only
meaningful when applied to lines of type t=&quot;li&quot;.</t>
<t hangText="a">
The alignment of the text in the line. (a, m, r, j)
a = align left = centered = alighted right = justified</t>
<t hangText="d">
The display direction of the line
l = left to right, r = right to left</t>
</list>
</t>
</section><section title="image"><t>
The image element represents an attached image embedded in
the blip. The image element has an 'attachment' attribute
that is the id of that attachment's data document.
Attachments and attachment documents are described in the
Google Wave Attachments whitepaper.</t>
</section><section title="reply"><t>
The reply element denotes the location of an inline reply
thread. It has an attribute 'id' that contains the id of the
thread whose location it marks. Thus an inline reply's inline
location is marked with a reply element.</t>
</section></section><section title="Annotations"><t>
The following are the allowed annotations allowed in blip
documents.</t>
<section title="Style"><t>
Style annotations control the display of the content in the
blip. All style annotations have names that begin with
&quot;style/&quot;. The allowed values for the style annotations are
the same as those of the CSS properties of the same name.</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
style/backgroundColor</t>
<t>
style/color</t>
<t>
style/fontFamily</t>
<t>
style/fontSize</t>
<t>
style/fontStyle</t>
<t>
style/fontWeight</t>
<t>
style/textDecoration</t>
<t>
style/verticalAlign</t>
</list>
</t>
</section><section title="User"><t>
The following annotations refer to a user id
and a session id. Each client gets its session
id from the server. Session ids, their
assignment, and how they are transmitted to a
client are out of scope for this document. It
should be noted that to avoid name clashes when
federating waves the session id should include
the domain of the server generating them.
Style annotations control the display of the
content in the blip.</t>
<t>
User annotations contain information that is
specific to each user session. All user
annotations begin with 'user/'.</t>
<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="user/d/&lt;session id>">
This annotation covers the entire
document. The value of the
annotation is a comma separated
list of (userid, timestamp [,ime
composition state]) The timestamp
is the last time the cursor was
updated. The timestamp may be used
by clients to stop dislpaying the
users carat after a period of
inactivity.</t>
<t hangText="user/r/&lt;session id>">
This annotation represents the
users selection. That is, the range
of text with this annotation is
text that the user has selected. If
the user does not have any text
selected then this annotation is
not present. Note that the
currently implementation only
supports a single selection region
per user. The value of this
annotation is the user id.</t>
<t hangText="user/e/&lt;session id>">
This annotation represents the
user's selection focus (the &quot;blinky
bit&quot;). The first point in the range
of the annotation is the cursor
location for the users session.
That is, the cursor is placed
before the first item in the
annotation range. This annotation
always extends from the cursor
position to the end of the
document. If this annotation is
missing then the cursor is placed
after the last item in the
document. The value of this
annotation is the user id.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section><section title="Links"><t>
Link annotations define links to
other resources. All link annotations have names that begin
with &quot;link/&quot;.</t>
<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="link/manual">
A manually created link. A URI or IRI? is the only valid
value for this annotation.</t>
<t hangText="link/auto">
A link created automatically by some linkifying process. Such annotations have a
lower precedence than manual links. A URI is the only valid
value for this annotation.</t>
<t hangText="link/wave">
A link to another wave. Wave ids are the only valid values
for this annotation.</t>
</list>
</t>

    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;and inexplicable. There is another

<section title="Private In-line Replies"><t>
The above shows the conversation with inline replies. Here is the same
conversation, but the replies are private in-line. This conversation will
display differently from the above two conversations.</t>
<t>
The conversation manifest has an id of &quot;conversation&quot; and
is an contained in the wavelet with an id of 'wave+a'.</t>
<figure>

&lt;conversation&gt;
    &lt;blip id=&quot;b+a&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt;

    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;that if ever anybody
    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;discovers exactly what the

    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;has already happened.
&lt;/body&gt;</artwork>

<t>
The replies are contained in another wavelet with an id of 'wave+b'.</t>
<t>
Being a wavelet it has its own conversation manifest:</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
&lt;conversation
    sort=&quot;r&quot;
    anchorWavelet=&quot;wave+a&quot;
    anchorBlip=&quot;b+a&quot;

    anchorVersion=&quot;12&quot;
    anchorOffset=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
   &lt;blip id=&quot;b+b&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt;
   &lt;blip id=&quot;b+c&quot;&gt;&lt;/blip&gt;
&lt;/conversation&gt;</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
The reply blips are in the 'wave+b' wavelet. There is the reply blip with an id of &quot;b+b&quot;:</t>

&lt;contributor name=&quot;fred@acmewave.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/contributor&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;Yes it is.
&lt;/body&gt;</artwork>

</section></section></section></section><section title="Display"><t>
The structure and relationships between wavelets, conversation manifests
and blips defines a logical structure for conversations. What follows is a
description of how the content and structure defined is presented in a
user-interface, fully realizing that implementing wave on different clients
will impose different constraints. The below isn't meant to constrain client
implementations, but to give guidance on providing a consistent user
experience.</t>
<t>
A conversation should be displayed as a single unit and
may reference more than one wavelet. A wavelet is
considered to be in a conversation view if it has a wavelet
id in the &quot;conv&quot; namespace and the user has permission to
access the wavelet. Wavelets other than the root in a
conversation view should reference another via an
anchorWavelet attribute.</t>
<t>
Blips are displayed in the order that they
appear in the conversation manifest, going from top to bottom. Blip documents
in a wavelet that are not referenced in the conversation manifest should not be
displayed. Threads are indented from the content of their parent blip unless
they have a property value of inline=true. The location of private replies is
determined by the &quot;anchorWavelet&quot;, &quot;anchorManifestOffset&quot;, &quot;anchorVersion&quot;,
&quot;anchorBlip&quot;, and &quot;anchorOffset&quot; properties of the conversation element. Note
that the anchor position is given for version at which the private reply was
created, and is recorded in the &quot;anchorVersion&quot; attribute. The proper display
location for the private reply will depend upon keeping track of how that
historical position moves as documents are mutated.</t>
<t>
The location of
non-private inline replies is denoted with a reply element in the thread and
should be displayed indented at that location.</t>
<t>
The display of private
inline replies should include an indication that it is private, such as
displaying the participants for that wavelet, along with the content of the
sub-conversation.</t>
</section><section title="Mechanisms"><t>
This section describes some mechanisms for changing the conversation
structure. Additional mechanisms remain to be defined. In addition, the
interactions of concurrent modifications have yet to be detailed.</t>
<section title="Creating a new blip"><t>
To add a new blip to a thread an operation is sent to
insert a blip element (with a unique id) to the thread in the conversation
manifest. The added blip document may or may not be empty</t>
</section><section title="Creating a reply thread"><t>
To add a new thread an operation is sent to insert a thread
element (with a unique id) to the replied-to blip element in the conversation
manifest. If the thread is an inline reply an anchor element must first be
inserted in the replied to blip.</t>
</section><section title="Deleting a blip"><t>
Deleting a blip involves deleting the blip, any inline replies to the blip, and
(optionally) any non-inline replies to the blip. This mechanism deletes only
inline replies.</t>
<t>
A blip is deleted by sending mutations that:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Delete all subordinate inline threads by:
- Deleting all blips in the thread
- Removing the thread element from the conversation manifest</t>
<t>
Transform the blip's document to an empty document</t>
<t>
Set the &quot;deleted&quot; attribute value to 'true' on the blip's conversation
manifest element if the blip has non-inline replies, else deletes the element
entirely.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
After a blip is deleted, non-inline replies to that blip are still nested
within their parent in the conversation manifest. They may be rendered as
children of a deleted blip. Future restructure operations may allow the
children to be re-parented. If a deleted blip has no remaining replies then the
blip entry should be deleted from the conversation manifest document. If the
deleted blip was the last in a thread then the thread entry should be removed
from the manifest document.</t>
<t>
Edits that occur concurrently with a blip
deletion are nullified in transform. Concurrently created replies to a deleted
blip are deleted if the blip has no replies, but survive if the blip element
remains (with &quot;deleted&quot; set to &quot;true&quot;).</t>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.
